CONTRIBUTING

Contributions are welcome, and are accepted via pull requests. Please review these guidelines before submitting any pull requests.
Guidelines

- Ensure that the current tests pass, and if you've added something new, add the tests where relevant.
- Remember that we follow SemVer. If you are changing the behaviour, or the public api, you may need to update the docs.
- Send a coherent commit history, making sure each individual commit in your pull request is meaningful. If you had to make multiple intermediate commits while developing, please squash them before submitting.
- You may also need to rebase to avoid merge conflicts.
